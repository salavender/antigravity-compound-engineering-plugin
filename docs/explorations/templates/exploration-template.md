# {Exploration Title}

## Question
{Specific, answerable question. What are we trying to understand?}

## Scope
- **Time-box:** {duration}
- **Success Criteria:** {what counts as "done"}
- **Out of Scope:** {explicit exclusions}

## Best Practices Research

### Industry Standards
{What did internet research reveal? Summarize key findings.}

### Sources
- [Source 1](url)
- [Source 2](url)

## Multi-Order Analysis (Think Hard)

### Direct Effects (1st Order)
{Immediate, obvious impacts of the potential change/discovery}

### Ripple Effects (2nd-4th Order)
- **2nd Order:** {What depends on the 1st order effects?}
- **3rd Order:** {Cascading consequences, system-wide drift?}
- **4th Order:** {Long-term cultural/architectural shifts?}

### Stakeholder Impact Matrix
| Stakeholder | Potential Impact | Severity |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| End Users | | |
| Developers | | |
| Ops/Support | | |
| Downstream Systems | | |

## Findings

### Key Learnings
1. {Learning with evidence}
2. {Learning with evidence}

### Evidence
{Code snippets, logs, terminal output, screenshots}

## Long-Term Implications
- **6 months:** {How does this age?}
- **1 year:** {How does this age?}
- **Reversibility:** {Can we undo this easily?}
- **Tech Debt Impact:** {Creates/Reduces/Neutral}

## Decision

**Recommendation:** {/plan | /specs | todo | no action | escalate}

**Rationale:** {Why this path?}

## Next Steps
- [ ] {Actionable follow-up if any}
